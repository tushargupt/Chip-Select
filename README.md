## Specifications

Chip Dropdown is a dynamic and user-friendly input component designed to facilitate item selection. It provides the following features:

- Clicking on the input field displays a list of items.
- Dynamic filtering of the item list as you type in the input field.
- Clicking on an item turns it into a chip at the top, automatically adjusting the input field.
- Converted chips are removed from the list for selection.
- Each chip has an "X" icon for easy removal, adding the item back to the list.

## Bonus Task

In addition to the core functionality, the Chip Dropdown implementation includes:

- Clean and well-documented code for easy understanding and maintenance.
- Utilization of TypeScript for enhanced type safety.
- Highlighting of the last chip when the input is blank and the user presses backspace. Pressing backspace again removes the highlighted chip.
- Pressing enter after searching for an particular item will select that item.
